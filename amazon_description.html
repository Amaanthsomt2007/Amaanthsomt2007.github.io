        <p>
This project is a fully responsive Amazon-style eCommerce frontend built to demonstrate my ability to design and structure large-scale online shopping platforms. The interface mimics real-world eCommerce behavior, including product listings, search functionality, cart interactions, and a smooth checkout flow. The project focuses on usability, responsiveness, and clean UI patterns commonly found in modern eCommerce websites.

        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>
Users are greeted with a familiar Amazon-like homepage featuring product categories and listings. The search bar allows users to type and receive instant suggestions and results beneath the category selector. Products can be explored, added to the cart, and reviewed before proceeding to checkout. JavaScript handles real-time interactions such as searching, cart updates, and UI responsiveness, creating a smooth and realistic shopping experience.
        </p>

        <h2>Challenges Overcome</h2>
        <p>
One of the main challenges was managing layout consistency across different screen sizes, especially on mobile devices. I also worked through complex UI interactions such as search result positioning, cart updates, and responsive product grids. Debugging mobile-specific spacing and alignment issues helped strengthen my problem-solving skills and attention to detail.
        </p>

        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <p>
This project deepened my understanding of eCommerce UI structure, responsive design patterns, and real-world frontend problem solving. I improved my JavaScript logic for handling dynamic user interactions and learned how to build scalable layouts suitable for large online stores.
