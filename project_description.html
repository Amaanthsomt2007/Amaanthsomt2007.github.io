        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This project is a clean and persuasive affiliate marketing landing page designed to showcase how effective frontend design can boost conversions. It highlights my ability to create compelling layouts, persuasive sections, and attention-grabbing visuals using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The page follows modern marketing principles and adapts beautifully to both mobile and desktop screens.

        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>The landing page presents users with a bold hero section that delivers the main message instantly. As users scroll, they move through carefully structured sections that highlight the product’s features, benefits, and proof elements. The design guides the viewer toward the primary call-to-action button, increasing the likelihood of clicks or sign-ups. JavaScript handles smooth scrolling, small animations, and interaction enhancements that make the experience more polished.</p>
        <h2>Challenges Overcome</h2>
        <p>One of the main challenges was balancing persuasive marketing design with a minimalist, clean layout. I focused on spacing, typography, and color contrast to ensure the page communicates clearly without feeling cluttered. I also had to fine-tune mobile responsiveness, especially around image scaling and text alignment for smaller screens.</p>
        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <p>This project improved my understanding of landing-page psychology, UI layout flow, and how to structure content in a way that increases engagement. I also strengthened my mobile-first design approach and refined my use of JavaScript for enhancing user experience without overwhelming the page.
