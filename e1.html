        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p> 
            The page introduces the product through a prominent hero section containing marketing copy and a call-to-action button. When the button is clicked, JavaScript provides instant feedback to simulate a shopping flow. Below the hero section, feature highlights reinforce product benefits and credibility. CSS Flexbox handles layout alignment, while media queries ensure usability on smaller screens.

        </p>
        <h2>Challenges Overcome</h2>
        <p>
            One challenge was ensuring the layout remained visually balanced on both desktop and mobile devices. I also resolved minor styling and spacing inconsistencies while refining button interaction and image presentation to maintain a clean, professional look.
            
        </p>
        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <p>This project strengthened my skills in debugging layout issues, fixing small UI glitches, and improving responsive behavior. I also gained better control over combining CSS Flexbox with JavaScript-driven interactions in a real-world landing page scenario.
